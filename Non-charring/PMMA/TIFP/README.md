### Experimental Conditions: TGA, DSC
TGA and DSC were performed simultaneously using an STA appartus.
STA experiments performed in nitrogen. Although tests were conducted simultaneously, TGA and DSC measurement data presented here are separated into two files, for consistency with other datasets.

##### STA Tests in Nitrogen
* Heating Rate: 10 K/min
* Temperature program
  - Initial temperature 300.15 K
  - Isotherm: 5 minutes
  - Maximum Temperature 823.15 K
* Sample mass: ~5.4 mg
* Sample geometry: powdered
* Calibration type: nitrogen 70 ml/min, Al2O3 crucible, open, 10 °C/min, 20 to 1000 °C, material In, Bi, Zn, Al, Ag
* Crucible type: Al2O3, 85 microliters, no lid
* Carrier Gas
  - Pure Nitrogen (0% O2)
  - Flow rate = purge flow 50 ml/min + protective 20 ml/min

### Experimental Conditions: Cone Calorimeter
* Radiant heat flux 25 and 65 kW/m2, three runs were performed for each heat flux. Backside tempereature measured by K type thermocouples glued to the sample in the middle (x=0, y=0) and at location x=-25 mm, y=0. Sample surface area 0.0084 m2.
* Extraction flow rate: 24L/s
* Sample holder dimensions:
    - according to ISO 5660-1, stainless steel
    - Retainer frame/grid: frame was used
* Backing Insulation: earth-alkali silicate wool, [thickness?], thermal conductivity at 600 °C 0.16 kW/m/K 
* Thermocouple location:
    - Temperature1: glued to back surface of sample, at center
    - Temperature2: glued to back surface of sample, x=-25 mm, y=0
